## Hey, I'm Yasin 👨‍💻

A code whisperer with too many private repos and not enough public bragging rights.

I've been around the block — building, breaking, fixing, and deploying projects that (sadly) live behind NDA walls and private orgs. Most of my real work? It's like Fight Club: I can't talk about it. 😅

But here's what I can say:

🧠 I love turning complex ideas into working products

🛠️ Mostly in love with JavaScript, Node.js, and modern web tech

🧪 Automation geek: I make boring things disappear

🕹️ Passionate about clean architecture, smart UIs & scalable APIs

📦 Occasionally ship tools & experiments in the open

🤝 Open to collabs, freelance, and cool side quests

If you're looking for noisy repos, you're at the wrong door.
But if you're looking for someone who actually gets things done — let's talk.
